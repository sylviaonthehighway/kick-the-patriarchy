# KICK THE PATRIARCHY
A game I made a few years ago. It's all in the name: you kick a box representing the patriarchy.
# NOTES
The .FLA file here is one of two versions: the CS5.5 version (which is here!) and another undetailed version, but probably for Adobe Animate or something. Also, it's fully playable online with Ruffle! Wowee!
